                        <h3>What is a Social Media Policy?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Having a social media policy for your business is essential in making sure your employees know what they should and should not do on social channels. Plus, it can help your company curb any legal or security issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A social media policy simply outlines how an organization and its employees should conduct themselves via the web. It helps protect your company’s online reputation and encourages employees to also get involved in sharing about the company in their online networks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The challenge is many companies do not know how to best organize a good social policy and want to ensure employees are actually reading it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To do so, this means keep it simple, clear, accessible, and continued to be updated. The goal is to not frustrate your workforce or discourage employees from participating in social media. But, it does need to emphasize some basic conduct so there are no major issues in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Strengths</h3>
                        <p>
                            Clear distinction between official and unofficial social media posting. “Whether through social media or other forms of public speaking, you may not represent that you are speaking on behalf of Our unless you are authorized to do so by Our Public Relations.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tying behavior back to a company’s principles and values is a strong move. Those principles shouldn’t just be lip service, so now is a good time to lean on them. “If you engage in social media, you are expected to protect our brand always and adhere to our key social principles of being authentic, involved, responsible, and respectful.”
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                        <p>
                            For a policy that repeatedly distinguishes between official and unofficial roles, it’s surprising to see a lack of sample disclaimer language (e.g. “Views expressed are my own”) that employees can use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nothing around how to handle crises and conflict.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’d like to see more enthusiasm around encouraging employees to participate online. We do realize, however, that there may be additional language we’re not seeing in an internal document.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In general, there are details missing that could’ve been broken down into more concrete, specific bullets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of our favorite intros to could have ended up as an overly complicated social media policy: “Guidelines for functioning in an electronic world are the same as the values, ethics and confidentiality policies employees are expected to live every day, whether you’re Tweeting, talking with customers or chatting over the neighbor’s fence. Remember, your responsibility to Best Buy doesn’t end when you are off the clock. For that reason, this policy applies to both company sponsored social media and personal use as it relates to Best Buy.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Clear Do’s and Don’ts. We even like that the latter are phrased as “What You Should Never Disclose”, which is more specific and clearer than a plain old “Don’t.”
